**VeriDIP: Verifying Ownership of Deep Neural Networks through Privacy Leakage Fingerprints**
=============================================================

Introduction
------------

This repository contains the implementation of VeriDIP, a novel approach to verifying ownership of deep neural networks (DNNs) through privacy leakage fingerprints. Our method enables the identification and quantification of DNN ownership by analyzing the unique characteristics of the model's privacy leakage patterns.
